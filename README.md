# Android Clean Architecture Boilerplate #

The following project is a POC for getting knowledge about applying Clean Architecture in order to build an Android application.

It's written 100% in Java, pending to convert it to Kotlin. It has unit tests and I try to be keeping up-to-date as libraries changes.


The sample app when run will show you a simple list of people and you can access to the detailed view of each one:
